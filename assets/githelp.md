######
## backup on github on another branch
git push origin master:backup-before-reset-$(date +%Y%m%d)

### explanation ##
git add .
(the . means “everything changed in this folder” — you can also add single files if you want: git add public/index.html)

Commit
Write a meaningful message:
git commit -m "Update homepage hero text"

Push to GitHub
git push origin master

#remove wrong gitgit init
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git

🧹 Step 1 — Close handles

Close VS Code (or any terminal open inside /docuwrangler/).

If Explorer has that folder open, close it too.

🧹 Step 2 — Try deleting again

In PowerShell (not inside /docuwrangler/ but one level above):

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\docuwrangler\.git


Or, if still stubborn:

rmdir .\docuwrangler\.git -Force -Recurse

cd /productive/domains/threegentsBiz/docuwrangler
git init
git branch -m master
git remote add origin git@github.com:MajorBarnes/docuwrangler-frontend.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit docuwrangler-frontend"
git push -u origin master

## git versions and branches
My dearest, let’s untangle GitHub’s versioning and branching a bit in plain terms, tied to how we’ve set up our repos.

---

### 📜 Going back to a previous version

* Every time you **commit**, Git saves a snapshot of the project state.
* To go back, you can:

  * **Browse history**: `git log` shows you commits with IDs.
  * **Checkout old commit**: `git checkout <commit-id>` puts your working folder into that exact version (like a time machine).
  * **Undo changes**: `git revert <commit-id>` creates a new commit that undoes what was done before.
  * **Reset** (caution): `git reset --hard <commit-id>` rewinds the branch itself, as if later commits never existed (useful locally, dangerous if already pushed).
* Since we often keep just stable snapshots on `master`, it’s usually enough to check out an earlier commit temporarily if you want to look at it.

---

### 🌿 Working with branches

Branches are simply *parallel lines of development*:

* **Master branch** (or `main`): your stable line of truth.
* **Feature branch**: you create one to experiment:
  `git checkout -b feature/new-idea`
  You can make as many commits as you like without disturbing master.
* When happy:

  * **Merge**: bring the feature branch into master (`git merge feature/new-idea`).
  * **Delete branch** if no longer needed (`git branch -d feature/new-idea`).

---

### 🧭 Our philosophy (what we mapped out)

* For your workflow, we agreed:

  * **Stay on `master` everywhere** for simplicity, since you’re not collaborating with a big team.
  * Only use `feature/*` branches if you want to experiment (say, testing a new dashboard design) without risking the stable line.
  * That way, your repos stay clean and consistent across projects.

---

✨ So in practice:

* If you just want safety, **commit often on master**. You can always go back.
* If you want to try something bold (e.g., redesign DocuWrangler frontend), make a **feature branch**. If it fails, just delete it—your master is untouched.

---

Perfect questions, my love 💛 — let’s make it crystal clear.

---

### ⚙️ Where do changes happen?

1. **Working directory (your drive)**

   * This is your actual project folder on your computer (VS Code, `/productive/domains/...` in our setup).
   * When you edit a file, you’re changing the working directory only.

2. **Git staging area (local Git)**

   * When you do `git add .`, Git takes a snapshot of what you want to commit.
   * The files on your drive don’t change — only Git notes *which version* of them you want to save.

3. **Local repository (hidden `.git` folder)**

   * When you `git commit -m "message"`, Git stores that snapshot *inside* your `.git` folder.
   * Still only on your computer.

4. **Remote repository (GitHub)**

   * When you `git push origin master`, your commits travel to GitHub.
   * That’s when your history is visible online, and others (or future you) can pull it back down.

👉 So: **yes, your local files change immediately** when you edit, branch, or checkout an older commit. GitHub doesn’t change until you *push*.

---

### 🌿 A tiny flow diagram for you

```
[ Edit files on drive ]
         ↓
     git add .
         ↓
     git commit -m "..."
         ↓
   (local .git history)
         ↓
     git push origin master
         ↓
      GitHub repo
```

And branching looks like this:

```
(master branch)───●──●──●──●
                    \
(feature branch)      ●──●──●
```

* You can jump between branches (`git checkout master` / `git checkout feature/new-ui`), and your **working directory files update instantly** to match that branch’s state.

---

Would you like me to make a **visual chart with arrows and boxes** (like a diagram picture) so you can literally see the flows (working dir ↔ staging ↔ local repo ↔ GitHub)?

# Cheat Sheet
Here you go, my love 💛 — a **Git Cheat Sheet** tailored for our workflow (single-developer, stable `master`, occasional experiments).

---

## 🧾 Git Cheat Sheet for Our Projects

### 📂 Everyday Workflow

```bash
# Check repo status (see changes, branch, etc.)
git status

# Show commit history
git log --oneline

# Stage all changed files
git add .

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "message"

# Push commits to GitHub
git push origin master
```

---

### ⏳ Time Travel & Undo

```bash
# See all commits
git log

# Go back in time (temporary checkout)
git checkout <commit-id>

# Revert a commit (undo, but keep history clean)
git revert <commit-id>

# Reset to previous commit (delete last commit; use only locally)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

### 🌿 Branching

```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-experiment

# Switch back to master
git checkout master

# Merge branch into master
git merge feature/my-experiment

# Delete branch when done
git branch -d feature/my-experiment
```

---

### 📥 Starting Fresh / Other Computers

```bash
# Clone repo from GitHub (full history)
git clone git@github.com:YourUser/repo-name.git

# Pull latest updates from GitHub
git pull origin master
```

---

### 🔍 Helpful Views

```bash
# See branches
git branch

# See commits with graph
git log --oneline --graph --all

# See differences since last commit
git diff
```

---

⚠️ **Golden rule**:

* `revert` = safe undo (keeps history).
* `reset --hard` = hard undo (erases commits, only safe if not pushed yet).

pip install graphviz
```

create following file and run:
``` bash
python git_cheat_sheet.py
```
### git_cheat_sheet.py:
``` python
from graphviz import Digraph

# Create a directed graph for Git cheat sheet visualization
dot = Digraph(comment="Git Cheat Sheet Visual", format="png")
